The game is played in the command prompt


GRID_SIZE:
grid-size is the number of the size of the grid
eg.
<grid-size> 3
grid:	   1.   2.   3.
	1.
	
	2.
	
	3.

HOW IS THE GAME PLAYED?
Just like in minesweeper you choose a field that you want to check.
eg.
	(0,0)(0,1)
	(1,0)(1,1)
for (0,1) -> <mineseater> 01

You have to check every single field that does not contain a bomb to win the game
