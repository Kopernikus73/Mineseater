The game takes place in the Command Prompt

GRID_SIZE:
The grid-size refers to the dimensions of the grid. For instance:
<grid-size> 3
The grid would appear as follows:

grid:     1.   2.   3.
          2.
          3.
HOW TO PLAY:
Similar to Minesweeper, you select a field to check.
For example:
    (0,0) (0,1)
    (1,0) (1,1)
For the field (0,1), you'd type it as:
<mineseater> 01

-- output: Adjacent bombs: 1 (if one of the adjacent fields contain a bomb)

Adjecent refers to the field directly next to, below or above the field.
For example:

(0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0)


To win the game, you must check every field that does not contain a bomb.
